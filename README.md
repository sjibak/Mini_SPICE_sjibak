## Implementation
1. Datasets are loaded using "data_files/dataloader.py"
2. Constant Q Transform is generated for the datasets in "generate_data.py" and stored in directory "CQT_data" 
3. The Entire model along with two Decoders can be found in "utils/model.py"
4. Training Methodology is present is "utils/training_script.py"
5. We train the model with our data in "train.py" and store the loss values in a numpy dictionary
6. The preliminary evaluation and comparision with original model can be found at "spice.ipynb" notebook
